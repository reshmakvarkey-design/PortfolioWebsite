            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                From 25 weeks manual drafting to an 8 week, AI assisted submission draft workflow in a global pharma
                organization.

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>
                Regulatory submission authoring is typically slow because writers must reconcile scattered data sources,
                enforce CTD/eCTD structure, and maintain cross‑document consistency while meeting aggressive filing
                targets. In many organizations, the initial draft alone consumes months, even though the overall
                industry is now aiming for single‑digit week submission timelines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pharmaceutical companies spend months preparing regulatory submission documents, with 80% of the time
                consumed by manual formatting, data compilation, and compliance checking.
            </p>

            <h3>User Research: Interviewing Users</h3>
            <p>
                To understand the real bottlenecks in our 25–16 week submission process, I conducted six in-depth
                interviews with medical writers, regulatory leads, and quality reviewers. Each 60-minute session
                combined open-ended questions with walkthroughs of their latest submissions, so I could see both their
                tools and their workarounds in context.
            </p>
            <p>
                I focused on four areas: how they gathered source documents, how they used templates today, how review
                cycles actually unfolded, and what scared them about AI-generated content. This helped me separate
                ‘noise’ (complaints about generic tooling) from critical needs tied to compliance and traceability.

                Based on the user needs and business needs, considered some of the major features and did a competitive
                analysis to get some inspiration and also to identify the best possible solution for our users.
                Considered few competitors like Veeva, IQVIA, Writerly, Draftable, IBM, Artos and Weave who have pharma
                based backgroud. The competitive analysis and user interviews gave me a better understanding of who the
                users were and how they might use the platform. I focused on expanding those findings into concrete
                visualizations that would help me empathize with users and define the product.

            <h3>Customer Journey Mapping</h3>
            <p>
                This customer journey map illustrates how regulatory writers collaborate with the platform from the
                moment they see existing submissions to the final download of a regulator‑ready document. It emphasizes
                not just the linear steps (configure template, map sources, generate, edit, export) but also the agentic
                layer: where the AI proactively recommends templates, suggests source documents, surfaces insights,
                maintains confidence scores, preserves manual edits during regeneration, and learns from user feedback
                over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                By framing the journey this way, your case study shows how the product transforms a manual, error‑prone
                process into a supervised, AI‑assisted workflow that still keeps writers in full control of compliance
                and narrative quality.

            <h3>User Needs (Impact Feasibility Matrix)</h3>
            <p>
                The Impact-Feasibility Matrix is a strategic tool used to prioritize features, initiatives, or design
                decisions by evaluating their potential impact against the effort or complexity required for
                implementation. In this project, the matrix helped balance high-value AI-driven capabilities, such as
                inline reference traceability and agentic chat iteration, with regulatory constraints and technical
                feasibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                This approach ensured that development focused first on features that would deliver maximum benefit to
                regulatory writers in terms of time savings, trust, and compliance, while managing risks and resource
                constraints effectively. Presenting this matrix in the case study demonstrates your analytical thinking
                and product prioritization skills in a complex, regulated environment.

                The goal of usability testing was to validate whether regulatory writers and leads could comfortably
                work with the AI co‑pilot across the full drafting workflow—from template setup to AI‑assisted
                iterations—without sacrificing control or trust. The focus was on learnability, transparency of AI
                behavior, and efficiency in completing realistic authoring tasks.

            <ul class="mt-sm">
                <li>Extend agent capabilities beyond drafting into pre‑submission readiness checks, automatically
                    scanning for typical regulator queries, missing justifications, or region‑specific requirements
                    before handoff.</li>
                <li>Deepen integrations with upstream and downstream systems (clinical data repositories, document
                    management, publishing tools) so the workspace becomes a single source of truth across the full
                    submission lifecycle.</li>
                <li>Introduce role‑based views and dashboards for regulatory leads and quality reviewers, summarizing
                    risk areas, insight resolution status, and submission readiness at a glance.</li>
                <li>Add in‑product onboarding and “safe AI” education tailored to regulatory users, helping new teams
                    understand what the agent can and cannot do, and how to supervise it effectively.</li>
                <li>Extend the drafting capabilities to other document types.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="mt-md">Key Learnings</h4>
            <ul class="mt-sm">
                <li><strong>Control & Traceability:</strong> Designing for regulated, expert users means optimizing for
                    control, traceability, and explainability first; speed is only valuable when users can see and trust
                    how the system reached its output.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborator, Not Oracle:</strong> Generative AI is most successful when framed as a
                    collaborator, not an oracle: the biggest shift was moving writers from “authoring from scratch” to
                    “curating and supervising a smart first draft.”</li>
                <li><strong>Details Matter:</strong> Small interaction details—like visible mapping status, explicit
                    chat context, and clear version history—had an outsized impact on trust and adoption compared to
                    more “flashy” AI features.</li>
                <li><strong>Scenario-Based Testing:</strong> Early, scenario‑based usability testing with real
                    regulatory users was critical: it surfaced non‑obvious risks (like fear of hidden automation) and
                    led directly to guardrails, confirmations, and UI language that made the agent feel safe to use in
                    real submissions.</li>
