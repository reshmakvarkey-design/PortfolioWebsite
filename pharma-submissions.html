            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Developing an AI-assisted submission drafting workflow for a global pharmaceutical organization to
                reduce
                submission timelines from 25 weeks to just 8 weeks.

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>
                Developing a new pharmaceutical drug is a marathon, requiring over a decade of clinical trials,
                toxicology reports, and manufacturing testing. The 'Regulatory Submission' is the critical moment where
                all those years of data must be consolidated into a single, flawless argument for health authorities.
            </p>

            <div class="mt-lg">
                <img src="./assets/images/pharma_submissions/problem_statement1.png" alt="Problem Statement 1"
                    class="project-image framed-thin">
            </div>

            <p class="mt-lg">
                Regulatory submission authoring is typically slow because writers must reconcile scattered data sources,
                enforce CTD/eCTD (Common Technical Document) structures, and maintain cross‑document consistency while
                meeting aggressive filing targets. In many organizations, the initial draft alone consumes months,
                despite the industry's push for single‑digit week submission timelines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pharmaceutical companies often spend months preparing these documents, with 80% of that time consumed by
                manual formatting, data compilation, and compliance checking.
            </p>

            <h3>Objectives and Goals</h3>
            <p>
                As a Product Designer, I frame my objectives at the intersection of the <strong>Business Mandate
                    (Speed)</strong> and the <strong>User Reality (Safety/Accuracy)</strong>. For this project, I built
                the narrative around three core pillars: eliminating "grunt work," establishing trust, and redefining
                the user's role.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-md">The Business Objective: Speed to Market</h4>
            <p>
                The pharmaceutical industry is aggressively moving toward single-digit week submission timelines.
                However, our internal data showed a stark reality: our drafting process took 16 to 25 weeks. The primary
                objective was to radically compress this timeline into an 8-week target, thereby accelerating the time
                to market for life-saving drugs.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-md">The Design Objective: Solving the "80% Problem"</h4>
            <p>
                To achieve that speed, I had to identify the bottlenecks. My research revealed that 80% of a medical
                writer's time was consumed by manual data gathering and formatting. Therefore, my design goal wasn't
                just "automation"; it was to shift the user's cognitive load from manual data reconciliation to
                strategic content supervision.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-md">The Strategic Goal: Trust as a Feature</h4>
            <p>
                In a regulated environment, trust is not just a benefit—it's an absolute necessity. The rigorous
                submission process is the pivotal moment where years of data must be consolidated into a flawless
                argument for health authorities. Establishing trust in the AI's output was paramount.

            <h3>User Research: Decoding the Drafting Experience</h3>
            <p>
                While we knew the metrics—a drafting process bleeding 16 to 25 weeks—quantitative data couldn't explain
                <em>why</em>. As the Product Designer, I needed to look beyond spreadsheets and enter the "black box" of
                the medical writer’s daily reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                I initiated a mixed-methods research phase. While I surveyed 45 regulatory professionals to establish a
                quantitative baseline for AI receptivity, the core of my strategy relied on deep, qualitative
                investigation.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mt-md">Methodology: Watch, Don't Just Listen</h4>
            <p>
                I conducted six in-depth interviews with medical writers, regulatory leads, and quality reviewers. These
                60-minute sessions combined open-ended questions with contextual walkthroughs. I asked participants to
                open their latest submissions and walk me through their real-time workarounds. This allowed me to see
                the friction points they had become so accustomed to that they no longer thought to complain about them.

                Analyzing insights from qualitative interviews revealed a distinct pattern: highly educated
                scientists—capable of complex medical argumentation—were being forced to act as data entry clerks. They
                spent 80% of their time on manual formatting and data compilation. Their frustration stemmed not from
                the difficulty of the work, but from its low value relative to their expertise. This insight helped
                crystallize our primary persona.

            <p>
                We weren't just building a document generator; we were solving a paradox: achieving 8-week timelines
                without sacrificing regulatory precision. I audited a spectrum of competitors, from industry giants like
                <strong>Veeva, IQVIA, and IBM</strong> to specialized tools like <strong>Artos and Weave</strong>, and
                general AI platforms like <strong>ChatGPT, Copy.ai, and Microsoft Copilot</strong>.

            <p>
                My goal was to identify gaps in how these platforms handled the heavy lifting of data compilation versus
                the nuance of human authorship. Specifically, I looked for patterns in how they managed the user's need
                for control—a critical requirement identified during our research.

                analyzing existing submissions to exporting a regulator‑ready document. It emphasizes the
                <strong>agentic layer</strong>, where the AI proactively recommends templates, suggests source
                documents, and maintains confidence scores. This transforms a manual, error‑prone process into a
                supervised, AI‑assisted workflow that keeps writers in full control of compliance and narrative quality.
